# Errors
there are many errors at the moment, refer to below for fixes / work arounds

    -N/a please report them if you find them

## profile explinations

defult is a bunch of standed commands

destiny is based of destiny 2 but is more or less a generic fps

minecraft does what its says on the tin

open world is a bunch generic openworld things such as camera movement etc



__use the file called runtwitchplays1.ps1 after set up/first use__


#disclaimers 

this is a work in progress feel free to modify as needed as well as pull requests etc

im not able to put up the native exe as it has a whole bunch of .dll etc (over 100 for some reason) thus the installer script was the next best option




## credits

i tried to make a launcher thing to make the process a bit more streamlined to the averange user,
